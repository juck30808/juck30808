    "## What Is Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a book about doing data science with Python, which immediately begs the question: what is *data science*?\n",
    "It's a surprisingly hard definition to nail down, especially given how ubiquitous the term has become.\n",
    "Vocal critics have variously dismissed the term as a superfluous label (after all, what science doesn't involve data?) or a simple buzzword that only exists to salt resumes and catch the eye of overzealous tech recruiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "這是一本介紹使用Python完成數據科學工作的書，那麼立刻就會帶來一個問題：什麼是數據科學？這是一個十分難以定義的概念，尤其是這幾年這個術語幾乎隨處可見。批評的聲音認為這是一個多餘的標籤（畢竟，哪樣科學不包含數據呢？）或者這只是一個為了博取關注而產生的流行詞彙。\n",
    "> In my mind, these critiques miss something important.\n",
    "Data science, despite its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and academia.\n",
    "This cross-disciplinary piece is key: in my mind, the best extisting definition of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram, first published on his blog in September 2010:\n",
    "\n",
    "這些批評忽略了一些重要的東西。數據科學除了部分炒作的成分外，可能是目前我們能夠找到的最合適的詞彙來表達這種跨學科領域的技術了，特別是越來越多的工業和學術應用都在使用它。這裡的關鍵是跨學科領域：最好表達數據科學的定義的方式是2010年 Drew Conway在他的Blog 發表的這張圖："

    "> While some of the intersection labels are a bit tongue-in-cheek, this diagram captures the essence of what I think people mean when they say \"data science\": it is fundamentally an *interdisciplinary* subject.\n",
    "Data science comprises three distinct and overlapping areas: the skills of a *statistician* who knows how to model and summarize datasets (which are growing ever larger); the skills of a *computer scientist* who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and the *domain expertise*—what we might think of as \"classical\" training in a subject—necessary both to formulate the right questions and to put their answers in context.\n",

    "雖然圖中，圓形重疊部分的標籤看起來很有些嘲諷的意味，但這張圖把握了當人們使用“數據科學”這個術語時候的精髓：最根本來說，數據科學是一門交叉學科。數據科學有三個領域交叉而成：\n",
    "- 需要統計學家來對數據集（正在變得越來越巨大）進行建模和統計；\n",
    "- 需要計算學家來使用算法有效地存儲、處理和展現這些數據；\n",
    "- 需要領域專家（通常在傳統意義上我們就是這麼做的）來在相關垂直領域整理出正確的問題和相應的解決方法。\n",
    "\n",
    "> With this in mind, I would encourage you to think of data science not as a new domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can apply within your current area of expertise.\n",
    "Whether you are reporting election results, forecasting stock returns, optimizing online ad clicks, identifying microorganisms in microscope photos, seeking new classes of astronomical objects, or working with data in any other field, the goal of this book is to give you the ability to ask and answer new questions about your chosen subject area.\n",

    "> Python has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets.\n",
    "This may have come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind.\n",
    "The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: *NumPy* for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, *Pandas* for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, *SciPy* for common scientific computing tasks, *Matplotlib* for publication-quality visualizations, *IPython* for interactive execution and sharing of code, *Scikit-Learn* for machine learning, and many more tools that will be mentioned in the following pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python在最近20年已經發展成為科學計算包括分析和展示大型數據集的最流行工具。這對於Python語言的早期支持者來說是一個驚喜：因為這門語言本身並不是專門為了數據分析和科學計算來設計的。 Python在數據科學中的蓬勃發展主要來源於其大量活躍的第三方包：Numpy用於處理同類的數組結構數據；Pandas用於處理不同種類和標籤化的數據；SciPy用於通用的科學運算任務；Matplotlib用於可打印標準的圖表展示；IPython用於交互式執行和共享代碼；Scikit-Learn用於機器學習，這些工具將在後續的章節中介紹。\n",

    "\n",
    "> This book uses the syntax of Python 3, which contains language enhancements that are not compatible with the 2.x series of Python.\n",
    "Though Python 3.0 was first released in 2008, adoption has been relatively slow, particularly in the scientific and web development communities.\n",
    "This is primarily because it took some time for many of the essential third-party packages and toolkits to be made compatible with the new language internals.\n",
    "Since early 2014, however, stable releases of the most important tools in the data science ecosystem have been fully compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and so this book will use the newer Python 3 syntax.\n",

For example, when we define an integer in Python, such as ``x = 10000``, ``x`` is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values.\n",
